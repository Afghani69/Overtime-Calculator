# Overtime-Calculator

Overtime app for wife to use at work.

After completing my JavaScript course, I decided to put my knowledge to the test my creating an overtime calculator for my wife to use at work. Due to JS being the only language I knew, I didn't have experience using HTML or CSS. The app was very basic with little to no UI. The results printed to console and the input was a sad attempt at best.

This app will take my new knowledge of HTML, CSS & JS to create a complete, functioning and hopefully beautiful app which my wife can use without my help/guidance.

1 - This time I will start with the UI again. After the To-Do-List where I started with logic, I am in the mood for some designing.

2 - It's been a while since I commited anything. Though I haven't been idle. A lot of the formatting and basic logic has been completed. All that's left to do now is to do the major calculations for the different times. I have to say, dates are annoying...
